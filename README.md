Code to control my robo-wheelchairs.  Beauty &amp; The Beast.

I am building an autonomous robot on an electric wheelchair base.  Well...
two... so far...

One older wheelchair, alias "The Beast", and a newer shiny model, "Beauty".

The Beast is the current object of interest, building the initial control
systems and sensor nets.
